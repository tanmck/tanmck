## Hi, it's Tania ✍🏽✨

As an aspiring web developer, I love using my experience and skills to create user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing websites. I am sharpening my skills to become a full-stack developer with a focus on web development. I currently work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

I'm also an IT undergraduate of Western Governors University.

Join me as I turn creative ideas into digital experiences!!
